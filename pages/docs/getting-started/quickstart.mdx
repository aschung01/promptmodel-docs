# Quickstart ðŸš€

Integrate **Promptmodel** into your project in less than 5 minutes.

> We are currently in closed alpha. If you would like to try out Promptmodel, visit [here](https://app.promptmodel.run).
> You can also request a personal demo [here](https://calendly.com/sounhochung/30min).

## Installation

To install `promptmodel` run:

```bash copy
pip install promptmodel
```

## Setup

### CLI Login

```bash copy
prompt login
```

You will be redirected to the Promptmodel website for CLI login. After logging in, you can close the browser window and return to your IDE.

### Initialization

```bash copy
prompt init
```

This will generate the following file in the current directory. This file will be used as an entry point for the prompt engineering dashboard.

```python filename="promptmodel_dev.py" copy
"""This single file is needed to build the Client development dashboard."""

from promptmodel import Client

# Example imports
# from <dirname> import < objectname>

app = Client()

# Example usage
# This is needed to integrate your codebase with the prompt engineering dashboard
# app.include(< objectname>)

```

```python filename="promptmodel_dev.py"
# ...
from <dirname> import client as client_1
# ...
app.include(client_1)
```

## Code Integration

You can add code directly in `promptmodel_dev.py`, or import your modules containing `promptmodel` code.
After importing your modules, you must include them in the `app` object. This is needed to integrate them with the development dashboard.

> PromptModel manages your prompts on the cloud, so you can free your code from `.txt` files or raw strings.

```python
from promptmodel import Client, PromptModel

client = Client()

# You can simply fetch prompts
extract_keyword_prompts = PromptModel("extract_keyword").get_prompts()

# Or run Promptmodel directly
@client.register
def test():
    response = PromptModel("choose_service").run_and_parse({})
    print(response.parsed_outputs)
    # Example ouptut : {"service_name" : "make_account", "arguments" : "[name, email, password]"}
```

## Prompt Engineering

To start engineering your prompts, you can use the **Promptmodel CLI**.

### Opening the development dashboard

```bash copy
prompt dev
```

This will open the prompt engineering dashboard in your browser. Promptmodels will be automatically detected from your code, and displayed in the dashboard. You can now start engineering your prompts.

### Crafting your first prompt

Write and run your first prompt in the dashboard. You can view the output from the panel below.

![First prompt](/demos/engineering.gif)

#### I/O variables syntax

Placeholder for **inputs** can be defined just like writing a python f-string; by using curly braces `{}`.

```txt
Extract keywords from given passage:
{passage}
```

We provide parsing and automatic type conversion for LLM outputs. Currently supported parsing types are:

- Square brackets
- Double square brackets
- Html

Here is an example format for double square brackets:

```txt
[[variable type=str]]
output value here will be parsed correctly
[[variable]]
```

More output formats will be supported very soon. Synatx highlighting for prompts is also coming soon.

### Prompt engineering workflow

You can create new versions of your promptmodels by clicking the **Create Variant** button in the dashboard.

![Creating variant demo](./img/promptmodel-demo-variant.gif)

You can view differences with the previous version while writing your new version, which is a great way to keep track of your changes.

A new prompt version is created every time you click the **Run** button in the dashboard. Each version is automatically categorized into either `broken` or `working`, depending on whether the run was successful or not. You can evaulate the output, then update the category of the best prompt versions to `candidate`.

### Pushing prompt versions to deployment

Once you have at least one candidate prompt version, you can push the candidates to deployment by clicking the **Push to deployment** button in the dashboard. This will upload the candidate versions to the cloud, and make them available for use in deployment.

You can view and manage your deployed prompt versions in the deployment dashboard.

LLM token usage, latency, costs will be tracked for each promptmodel run. You can view these metrics in the deployment dashboard. _(coming soon)_

  Metric visualization & analytics based on human & LLM evaluation is also
  coming soon.
</Callout>

## Prompt Management

You can use the deployment dashboard to manage your deployed prompts.

Here you can publish specific prompt versions for use in deployment, create A/B tests _(coming soon)_, and view prompt usage statistics.
